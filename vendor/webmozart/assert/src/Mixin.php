		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty) and 
		that users may redistribute the program under</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these 
		conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp; 
		(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not 
		normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is 
		not required to print an announcement.)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These requirements 
		apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If identifiable sections of that 
		work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
		independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its 
		terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
		separate works.&nbsp; But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
		whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the 
		whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other 
		licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
		regardless of who wrote it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, it is not the 
		intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work 
		written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to 
		control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the 
		Program.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In addition, mere 
		aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program 
		(or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
		distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of 
		this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">3. You may copy and 
		distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in 
		object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
		provided that you also do one of the following:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany it 
		with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source code, 
		which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on 
		a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Accompany it 
		with a written offer, valid for at least three</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give 
		any third party, for a charge no more than your</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of 
		physically performing source distribution, a complete</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable 
		copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed 
		under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily used 
		for software interchange; or,</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany it 
		with the information you received as to the offer</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute 
		corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for 
		noncommercial distribution and only if you</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the 
		program in object code or executable form with such</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in 
		accord with Subsection b above.)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The source code for 
		a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to 
		it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
		code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
		definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
		installation of the executable.&nbsp; However, as a special exception, the 
		source code distributed need not include anything that is normally 
		distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
		(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the 
		executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
		executable.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If distribution of 
		executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
		designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
		code from the same place counts as</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">distribution of the 
		source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
		source along with the object code.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">4. You may not copy, 
		modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly 
		provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
		sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically 
		terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
		received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
		their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
		compliance.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">5. You are not 
		required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&nbsp; However, 
		nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
		or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are prohibited by law if you do 
		not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
		Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
		of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
		distributing or modifying</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the Program or works 
		based on it. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">6. Each time you 
		redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the 
		recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
		copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and 
		conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the 
		recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
		responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">7. If, as a 
		consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or 
		for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are 
		imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
		contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
		the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot distribute so as to 
		satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
		pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
		Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent license would not permit 
		royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive 
		copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
		satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
		distribution of the Program.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If any portion of 
		this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
		circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the 
		section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is not the 
		purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other 
		property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
		section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
		software distribution system, which is implemented by public license 
		practices.&nbsp; Many people have made generous contributions to the wide 
		range of software&nbsp; distributed through that system in reliance on 
		consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
		decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
		system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This section is 
		intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence 
		of the rest of this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">8. If the 
		distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
		countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
		copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an 
		explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, 
		so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
		excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
		written in the body of this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">9. The Free Software 
		Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public 
		License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
		to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
		or concerns.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Each version is 
		given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program specifies a 
		version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
		version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
		either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
		Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Program does not specify a version number 
		of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
		Software Foundation.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">10. If you wish to 
		incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose 
		distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
		permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
		Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
		exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
		preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
		of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">NO WARRANTY</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">11. BECAUSE THE 
		PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
		PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN 
		OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
		PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
		EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE 
		ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH 
		YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">PROGRAM PROVE 
		DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
		CORRECTION.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">12. IN NO EVENT 
		UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
		COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
		THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
		ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 
		THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
		LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
		YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
		OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&nbsp; ADVISED OF 
		THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">END OF TERMS AND 
		CONDITIONS</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">How to Apply These 
		Terms to Your New Programs</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you develop a new 
		program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the 
		public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
		everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To do so, attach the 
		following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest to attach them to the 
		start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of 
		warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
		pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&lt;one line to give 
		the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) 
		&lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>

		an interactive mode:</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Everyone is 
		permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
		document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[This is the first 
		released version of the Lesser GPL.&nbsp; It also counts as the successor of 
		the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 
		2.1.]</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Preamble</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The licenses for 
		most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change 
		it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to 
		guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure 
		the software is free for all its users. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This license, the 
		Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated 
		software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation 
		and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You can use it too, but we 
		suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the 
		ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
		particular case, based on the explanations below.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When we speak of 
		free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.&nbsp; Our 
		General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
		freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
		service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you 
		want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new 
		free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To protect your 
		rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny 
		you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.&nbsp; These 
		restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
		distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For example, if you 
		distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must 
		give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.&nbsp; You must make sure 
		that they, too, receive or can get the source code.&nbsp; If you link other 
		code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
		recipients, so that they can relink them</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">with the library 
		after making changes to the library and recompiling it.&nbsp; And you must 
		show them these terms so they know their rights. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We protect your 
		rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we 
		offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
		distribute and/or modify the library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To protect each 
		distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for 
		the free library.&nbsp; Also, if the library is modified by someone else and 
		passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
		original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be 
		affected by problems that might be introduced by others.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, software 
		patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.&nbsp; We 
		wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users 
		of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
		holder.&nbsp; Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a 
		version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use 
		specified in this license.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Most GNU software, 
		including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public 
		License.&nbsp; This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies 
		to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
		ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; We use this license for certain 
		libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free 
		programs.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When a program is 
		linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the 
		combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative 
		of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore 
		permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
		freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser General</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Public License 
		permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We call this license 
		the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the 
		user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp; It also 
		provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
		competing non-free programs.&nbsp; These disadvantages are the reason we use 
		the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.&nbsp; However, the 
		Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For example, on rare 
		occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible 
		use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.&nbsp; To 
		achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.&nbsp; A 
		more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely 
		used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">case, there is 
		little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we 
		use the Lesser General Public License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In other cases, 
		permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a 
		greater number of people to use a large body of free software.&nbsp; For 
		example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs 
		enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well 
		as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Although the Lesser 
		General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does 
		ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has 
		the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified 
		version of the Library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The precise terms 
		and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.&nbsp; Pay 
		close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" 
		and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The former contains code derived 
		from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library 
		in order to run.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">GNU LESSER GENERAL 
		PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, &nbsp;DISTRIBUTION AND 
		MODIFICATION.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">0. This License 
		Agreement applies to any software library or other program which 
		contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
		party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser 
		General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is 
		addressed as "you".</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A "library" means a 
		collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be 
		conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those 
		functions and data) to form executables.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The "Library", 
		below, refers to any such software library or work which has been 
		distributed under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the Library" means 
		either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
		to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
		verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">straightforwardly 
		into another language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
		limitation in the term "modification".)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">"Source code" for a 
		work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to 
		it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means all the source code for 
		all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, 
		plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
		library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Activities other 
		than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
		License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of running a program using 
		the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered 
		only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent 
		of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is 
		true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the 
		Library does.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. You may copy and 
		distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you 
		receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
		appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
		disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
		License and to the absence of any</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">warranty; and 
		distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You may charge a fee 
		for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option 
		offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2. You may modify 
		your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a 
		work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
		work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all 
		of these conditions: </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) The modified 
		work must itself be a software library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) You must 
		cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that you 
		changed the files and the date of any change.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) You must 
		cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge to all 
		third parties under the terms of this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If a facility 
		in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table of data to 
		be supplied by an application program that uses</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the facility, 
		other than as an argument passed when the facility</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is invoked, then 
		you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event an 
		application does not supply such function or</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; table, the 
		facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its purpose 
		remains meaningful.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example, a 
		function in a library to compute square roots has</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a purpose that 
		is entirely well-defined independent of the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.&nbsp; 
		Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be optional: if 
		the application does not supply it, the square</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; root function 
		must still compute square roots.)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These requirements 
		apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If identifiable sections of that 
		work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered 
		independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its 
		terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
		separate works.&nbsp; But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
		whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the 
		whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other 
		licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
		regardless of who wrote it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus, it is not the 
		intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work 
		written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to 
		control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the 
		Library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In addition, mere 
		aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library 
		(or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
		distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of 
		this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">3. You may opt to 
		apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of 
		this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do this, you must alter 
		all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
		ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this 
		License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
		Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead 
		if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in these notices.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Once this change is 
		made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary 
		GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and 
		derivative works made from that copy.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This option is 
		useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a 
		program that is not a library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">4. You may copy and 
		distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 
		2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
		above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding 
		machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms 
		of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
		interchange.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If distribution of 
		object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, 
		then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same 
		place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even 
		though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
		object code.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">5. A program that 
		contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to 
		work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a 
		"work that uses the Library".&nbsp; Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
		derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of 
		this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, linking a 
		"work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that 
		is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the 
		Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The executable is 
		therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for 
		distribution of such executables.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When a "work that 
		uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the 
		Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the 
		Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
		especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or 
		if the work is itself a library.&nbsp; The threshold for this to be true is 
		not precisely defined by law.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If such an object 
		file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and 
		accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or 
		less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, 
		regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.&nbsp; (Executables 
		containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall 
		under Section 6.)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Otherwise, if the 
		work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code 
		for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing 
		that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
		directly with the Library itself. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">6. As an exception 
		to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses 
		the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of 
		the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
		provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the 
		customer's own use and reverse</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">engineering for 
		debugging such modifications.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You must give 
		prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in 
		it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&nbsp; You 
		must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work during execution 
		displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for 
		the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the 
		copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one of these things:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the 
		work with the complete corresponding</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine-readable 
		source code for the Library including whatever</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes were 
		used in the work (which must be distributed under</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2 
		above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the 
		Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the 
		Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user can modify 
		the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executable 
		containing the modified Library. &nbsp;(It is understood</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the user 
		who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library will not 
		necessarily be able to recompile the application</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use the 
		modified definitions.)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a 
		suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp; A 
		suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the 
		library already present on the user's computer system,</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than 
		copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will operate 
		properly with a modified version of the library, if</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the user 
		installs one, as long as the modified version is</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Accompany the 
		work with a written offer, valid for at least</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; three years, to 
		give the same user the materials specified in</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsection 6a, 
		above, for a charge no more than the cost of</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; performing this 
		distribution.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) If 
		distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a 
		designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified 
		materials from the same place.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify that 
		the user has already received a copy of these</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials or 
		that you have already sent this user a copy.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For an executable, 
		the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any 
		data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from 
		it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed 
		need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source 
		or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) 
		of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that 
		component itself accompanies the executable.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It may happen that 
		this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other 
		proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
		system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the 
		&nbsp;Library together in an executable that you distribute.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">7. You may place 
		library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in 
		a single library together with other library facilities not covered by 
		this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the 
		separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
		library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do 
		these two things:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the 
		combined library with a copy of the same work</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the 
		Library, uncombined with any other library</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp; 
		This must be distributed under the terms of the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections above.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give 
		prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it 
		is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find 
		the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">8. You may not copy, 
		modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as 
		expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
		modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
		will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&nbsp; However, 
		parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License 
		will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain 
		in full compliance.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">9. You are not 
		required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&nbsp; However, 
		nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library 
		or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are prohibited by law if you do 
		not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
		Library (or any work based on the</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Library), you 
		indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and 
		conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works 
		based on it.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">10. Each time you 
		redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the 
		recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
		copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms 
		and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the 
		recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
		responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">11. If, as a 
		consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or 
		for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are 
		imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
		contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
		the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot distribute so as to 
		satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
		pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
		Library at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent license would not permit 
		royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
		copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
		satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
		distribution of the Library.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If any portion of 
		this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
		circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the 
		section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is not the 
		purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other 
		property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
		section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
		software distribution system which is implemented by public license 
		practices.&nbsp; Many people have made</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">generous 
		contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
		system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to 
		the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
		software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
		choice.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This section is 
		intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence 
		of the rest of this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">12. If the 
		distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
		countries either by patents or by &nbsp;copyrighted interfaces, the original 
		copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an 
		explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, 
		so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
		excluded.&nbsp; In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
		written in the body of this License.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">13. The Free 
		Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
		Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
		be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
		address new problems or concerns.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Each version is 
		given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library specifies a 
		version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
		version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
		either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
		Software Foundation.&nbsp; If the Library does not specify a</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">license version 
		number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
		Foundation.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">14. If you wish to 
		incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose 
		distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
		to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
		Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
		make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">decision will be 
		guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
		of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
		generally.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">NO WARRANTY</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">15. BECAUSE THE 
		LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
		LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
		OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
		PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
		EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE 
		ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH 
		YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
		NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">16. IN NO EVENT 
		UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
		COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE 
		THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
		ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF 
		THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
		LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
		YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY 
		OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
		THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">END OF TERMS AND 
		CONDITIONS</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">How to Apply These 
		Terms to Your New Libraries</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you develop a new 
		library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the 
		public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can 
		redistribute and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting redistribution 
		under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary 
		General Public License).</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">To apply these 
		terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to 
		attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey 
		the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
		"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&lt;one line to give 
		the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span></p>

		&lt;year&gt;&nbsp; &lt;name of author&gt;</span></p>
